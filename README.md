# Fight-Stick
Game controller optimized for fighting games

# Included Files
- Controller Code - This is the code used to allow the controller to run
- 3D STL Files - These are the 3D files that create the case of the controller
- Gerber Files - These are the designs for the PCB that houses the switches, lights, controller, etc.

# How to assemble 
### 3D Files
These will need to be printed or ordered from an online printing service
- Case

- You will also need key caps but they should be accessable online when looking up fight stick key caps

### PCB Design
- These pcb's will need to be ordered from a pcb screening facility. The assembly could be done manually or ordered from a company that does assembly as well as pcb creation. For my demos I have used JLC PCB which I would reccomend. All you need is the gerber file.


# Possible improvements
- Upgrade to another chip that allows for usb emulation and allowing for compatibility with consoles
- Improve Layout Ergonomics
- Hot Swap Switch Connections
- Multiple RGB Configurations
